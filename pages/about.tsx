            Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Francisco Moretti.
          </p>
          <p>
          I use Python to test robots to make sure that customers get high-quality goods.
          </p>
          <p>
          I share my journey in the world of web development and the insights I get along the way. 
          At the moment, I'm working with React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS.
          </p>
          <p>
          I like creating and using tools that make it easier for my teammates to produce their best work.
          I'm a big fan of improving development environments and automating tasks.
          </p>
          <p>
          I'm interested in clean code and great programming practices. I advocate kindness to the next reader of the code.
          </p>
          <p>
          The ultimate superpower is learning. That's why I'm passionate about learning strategies and how the brain functions.
