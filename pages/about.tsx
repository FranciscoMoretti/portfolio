            Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Francisco Moretti.
          </p>
          <p>
          I'm a software engineer who loves learning and lifting others while I climb. Nowadays, I automate simulations 
          of domestic cleaning robots using Python to make sure they are helpful for people in their homes.
          </p>
          <p>
          I share my journey into the world of web development and the insights I got along the way. At the moment, 
          I'm sailing with React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS.
          </p>
          <p>
          I love creating and using tools that help programmers achieve their best work without effort. 
          I'm a big fan of development environments and automating tasks.
          </p>
          <p>
          I'm interested in clean code and great programming practices. I advocate kindness to the next reader of the code.
          </p>
          <p>
          Mastering learning is the ultimate superpower, that's why I'm passionate about studying techniques and how the brain works.
