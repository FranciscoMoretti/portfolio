In the following series of posts, I'll be sharing the internals of designing a pragmatic coding interview that I got to know after interviewing folks for different tech positions for some time and here comes the first one.

### üß∞ Preparing a repository with the assignment.

Let me use [this Github repo](https://github.com/coreskills/python-developer-2020-04-16) as an example.

There are 4 basic rules that go like this:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Make sure to create boilerplate for everything that doesn't test for the skills you're looking for in your candidates. This will save everyone a lot of time while providing enough signal to make a hiring decision.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Make sure to provide a predefined automated way of testing candidates' solutions. This is how you define the minimal criteria necessary for passing your test.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Turn your assignment repo into a template. In Github, it goes as a default feature so you have an easy way to replicate one repo per candidate there.

4Ô∏è‚É£ And last, but not least. Define an issue template that explains the task to the candidate. This one saves you a good deal of time when creating a repo setup for every new candidate.

That's it for this one. Short & sweet. In the next post, we'll zoom in each of the rules.

‚úåÔ∏è Stay tuned & stay healthy.
