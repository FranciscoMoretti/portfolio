**Welcome!** This is my first blog post and I've found it to be the perfect
opportunity to share my _final year engineering project_.
**Voliner** is a name that came up by joining the Spanish words
_"Volante"_ (_flywheel_) and _"Inercia"_ (_inertia_). The project is
the **Development and implementation of an inertia
flywheel-based energy storage system with applications in a smart power grid**.
_I hope you like it!_

### Project scope:

- Creation of a flywheel energy storage system
- Design of the mechanical assembly
- Construction of a 3-phase AC-DC bidirectional electronic converter
- Implementation of software for the control system and bidirectional AC-DC conversion
- Development of a control strategy to stabilize voltage fluctuations
- Integration of active voltage regulation, start-up, shutdown and emergency subsystems
- Creation of a GUI with osciloscope-like plots and PID tuning tools
- Design and implementation of a commisioning rutine

## Motivation

The distributed location and intermittency of renewable energy sources (day
and seasonal cycles, as well as climatic and meteorological dependencies)
require reformulating three classic characteristics of interconnected systems:

- Unidirectionality of the power flow (from generation centers to consumers)
- Centralization of their management
- Generation based only on-demand requirements

**In order not to waste the available renewable energy,
excess generation must be injected into the system and/or stored until
required**, which requires multidirectional flow of power and
decentralized management, located in each network and planned according
to predictions of production and energy consumption.
This **requires real-time control systems to compensate for discrepancies** between
these forecasts and their actual manifestations. The concept of **Smart Grid** is a
potential way to address these challenges.

> ### Smart Grid
>
> - Power Grid equipped with a digital layer.
> - Allows planned management and real-time control of the generation, storage and consumption of energy.
> - Multidirectional flow of power inside the network.
> - Bidirectional flow of power in its interaction with the global power system.

## Summary

The work carried out is part of a project to expand the university's
intelligent micro-grid, by providing hybrid energy storage
for it. The energy storage solution designed has **three main components**:

- A **flywheel** (mechanical device to store kinetic energy)
- A three-phase **induction machine**
- A two-way **AC-DC electronic converter**

The objective is to **stabilize the _DC bus_ voltage
of the network**, suppressing both the medium frequency and high frequency components of
the currents circulating through the battery bank, conserving the batteries
health and improving the overall operation of the network.

> We’ll use the term **induction machine** and not induction motor
> because it operates as a **motor** (storing kinetic energy)
> or as a **generator** (returning stored energy) depending on circumstances.

The converter's control
strategies are implemented in a Texas Instruments F28335 DSP, programmed
in C language.

## Introduction

To increase the reliability and quality of the energy resource in a smart grid,
energy storage is needed. The devices to achieve it can be divided into
the following categories.

- **Conventional:** battery banks, capacitors
- **Unconventional:** reversible hydroelectric plants, hydrogen-based energy storage systems
  or systems based on **flywheels**.

Prior to the realization of
this project, the smart grid of the _Automation and Control Laboratory_
(LAC) had a single energy storage system, which is a bank of
lead-acid batteries. Due to its nature, its main weakness was the
_early degradation_ that batteries suffer when subjected to
micro cycles of charging and discharging, as well as repetitive current peaks.

To address
this problem, we introduced of a second energy storage component, in the form of a
_Flywheel Energy Storage System_ (_FESS_), thus obtaining **hybrid
energy storage**. This allows a separation, based on frequency,
of the current of the storage devices:

- Low frequency <-> battery bank
- Medium frequency <-> _FESS_
- High frequency <-> capacitors in the _DC bus_.

> Since the whole system is connected by a _DC bus_, we can assoiate
> currents with power (_P=IxV_ where _V_ is constant)

The following figure shows a **graphical representation of the resulting
hybrid energy storage system**, which is also the base _system model_ used to
create the control strategy:

![Grid model](/static/images/voliner/introduction.svg)

Hybrid energy storage resulting from the combination of a battery bank
and a _FESS_ is a solution that combines the _best of both worlds!_

  pros={[
    `Can withstand a high number of charges and discharges without degrading.`,

<ConsCard

  cons={[

/>

**All the disadvantages have less impact if we combine it with batteries!.
Batteries have a low self-discharge rate and a relatively high
energy capacity.**

The characteristics of both storage devices complement
each other. **The presence of the _FESS_ and capacitors allow both the
voltage of the _DC bus_ and the battery current to evolve smoothly
towards a new steady-state value**, not only **increasing battery life**,
but also **improving the overall operation of the smart grid**.

## Description of the Flywheel Energy Storage System

An inertia flywheel-based energy storage system (_FESS_) is an energy storage
device that uses a _rotating_ element to store **kinetic energy**. This element is
coupled with the shaft of an _electrical machine_ that works as a
transformer between the _electrical_ and _mechanical_ domains. The electrical
machine can work as a _generator_ or as a _motor_ in the following situations:

- **Motor:** Increase its _kinetic energy_ by accelerating the rotating element
  taking _electric energy_ from the grid.
- **Generator:** Decrease its _kinetic energy_ by slowing down the rotating element
  delivering _electric energy_ to the grid.

Normally the speeds at which the high axis rotates are quite
high (20000-50000 rpm) in order to store as much energy as possible,
since the rotating kinetic energy is proportional to the square of the
rotational speed. To decrease friction losses the rotating
element is usually placed in a vacuum chamber, with the shaft upright
and levitating magnetically. **This project consists of a small-scale
_FESS_ construction and control, for teaching and experimental purposes**,
so it will not have the latter and the rotational speed it’s going to
be lower. While its characteristics and dimensions are not the same as
that of a _FESS_ for higher power applications, **it's a device that serves
well to research both energy management strategies and induction
machine control**.

## Mechanical assembly

This section briefly describes on the design process of a series of _structural
components_ necessary for the correct and _safe operation_ of the system.
_SolidWorks 3D_ modeling software was used to perform simple and visual
representations.

The design process began with the modeling of the existing components.
Those are, the **inertia disks** (two identical disks were used)
and the **induction machine**.

![Intertia disk](/static/images/voliner/inertia_disk-700.jpg)

![Electric motor](/static/images/voliner/electric_motor-700.jpg)

Based on these 3D models all other components were designed:

- The **mechanical coupling** between the inertia disks (_flywheels_)
  and the electrical machine
- The **mounting base** to place and fix the _FESS_
- The protective **acrylic dome** that prevents accidental contact with the _moving parts_ of the system.

### Construction of the inertia flywheel

The solution adopted for the coupling consists of **two parts**, a commercial
**self-aligning coupling device** (BLK 130) and a **custom-made steel insert**.

The **steel insert** fulfills two functions:

- To provide an _adaptation_ between the _external diameter_
  of the self-aligning coupling and the _internal
  diameter_ of the intertia disks
- To provide a _structure_ that allows the
  _fastening of the disks to each other_, **transforming them into a single
  rigid piece**.

![Insert](/static/images/voliner/insert-700.jpg)

The **self-aligning coupling** can be adjusted with its _radial
expansion_ by tightening a series of bolts located on one of its faces.
When the expansion occurs, the coupling exerts pressure on the _motor shaft_
and _steel insert_, achieving the desired fastening.

![BLK 130](/static/images/voliner/BLK130-700.jpg)

By joining all the pieces, we obtain a rigid **flywheel composed of two inertia
disks** that can be directly fixed to the _motor axis_.

![Intertia assembly](/static/images/voliner/inertia_assembly-700.jpg)

### Mounting base

The design of the **mounting base** serves as a _support_ and elevates the machine
so that the flywheel can _rotate freely_. The frame is wide and has the minimum required
height in order to achieve _great stability_.

> The dimensions of the frame
> were chosen so that there is enough space to fit flywheels in the front of
> the engine and in the back, allowing a possible expansion of the system in
> a future upgrade (since the fan in the back of the motor can be replaced
> with another inertia disk).

_Structural pipe_ with a rectangular profile of 50x20x2mm
was chosen for its construction.

### Acrylic dome

The last component designed is an **acrylic dome** that covers the
_rotating parts_ of the system while providing a _mounting solution
for the encoder_. For its creation, an acrylic plate of 5mm of thickness was
carved by a CNC laser cutter.

Finally here is a _cross section_ view and a complete one of
the whole system SolidWorks model.

## Electronic Converter

The designed system consists of a _0.6kgms<sup>2</sup>_ _flywheel_ coupled to a
_1.1KW_ _three-phase induction machine_ and a _2KVA_ _AC-DC bidirectional
converter_.

**The converter can operate as a _three-phase inverter_ or
_three-phase rectifier_**. It is based on the integrated circuit
_Mitsubishi PS21A79_ that encapsulates
the _three-phase IGBTs bridge_
with their respective drivers and protections, and _Texas Instruments
F28335 DSP_ where control strategies are implemented.

![Converter front](/static/images/voliner/converter_front-700.jpg)

![Converter back](/static/images/voliner/converter_back-700.jpg)

## Control Strategy

**The control strategy implemented is an adaptation of**
[An Innovative Control Strategy of a Single Converter for Hybrid Fuel Cell/Supercapacitor Power Source](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5422652).
That proposes a way to decouple currents in the frequency domain for a _Fuel
cell_ and a _bank of supercapacitors_. For this variant **instead of the _fuel cell_, a _battery bank_
is used, and the place of the _supercapacitor bank_
is occupied by the _flywheel_**
(and the capacitors in the _DC bus_).

Let's see a simplified schema of the implemented control
topology, which is reduced to a number of nested PID controllers.

![Grid model](/static/images/voliner/control_scheme.svg)

- At the **inner level** we can see the regulators that control the induction
  machine's **currents in the _dq_ frame**, i.e. _i<sub>d</sub>_ and _i<sub>q</sub>_.
- The setpoint of the **_i<sub>d</sub>_** current is set to such a value that it generates
  the desired **magnetization level** for the machine.
- the **_i<sub>q</sub>_** current setpoint can be generated by two different
  controllers **depending on the operating mode** in which the system is located.
  - During **normal operation** the _i<sub>q</sub>_ reference is generated
    by the **voltage regulator** so that, for example,
    if you want to increase the voltage of the _DC bus_
    you get power from the flywheel by applying a negative torque (or a negative
    quadrature current).
  - For **complementary system operation** (start up, shutdown
    and limitations) the _i<sub>q</sub>_ setpoint is generated by the **speed control**
    controller.
- The **voltage regulator** reference is driven by the
  **recovery regulator**, responsible for
  - Keeping the flywheel
    spinning at a certain speed when the system is in stand by
  - Restoring that speed after an event in which the system delivers
    or absorbs energy.

> The **speed reference** is adjustable and should be chosen based on a
> _trade-off_, since represents the
> amount of energy that the system has stored and ready to deliver,
> but it also conditions the amount of energy that the system
> can absorb (due to the mechanical and electrical limitations
> of the machine).

## Experimental results

**Steps and pulses** of _4A_ load current were performed using a _resistor bank_
to _verify the correct operation_ of the designed _FESS_.
The results obtained in each test are compacted into a figure that shows:

- Components of the **stator current in the _dq_ frame** with their respective
  _setpoints_.
- **DC-side currents of the converter**, particularly the current by the
  _battery_ (_i<sub>bat</sub>_), the current by the _charge_ (_i<sub>load</sub>_),
  and the current delivered/absorbed by the _converter_ (_i<sub>FW</sub>_).
- **_DC bus_ voltage** (_V<sub>DC</sub>_), its _setpoint_ (_V<sub>dcRef</sub>_) and _voltage
  evolution with FESS disabled_ (natural). It should be noted
  that this last curve arises from a second test and not from a simulation or
  estimation.
- Rotation **speed of the flywheel** and its stand by speed (natural).

### Step test

We begin by analyzing the **system response to a _4A_ load step**.

1. When the step occurs the system _reacts_ by producing a negative flank
   of current _i<sub>q</sub>_ while the current _i<sub>d</sub>_
   remains constant.
2. The evolution
   of _i<sub>q</sub>_ is reflected in _i<sub>FW</sub>_ which
   implies that the charging current
   flank is delivered by the _FESS_ and not by the batteries.
3. The currents _i<sub>q</sub>_ and _i<sub>FW</sub>_ then evolve
   smoothly towards their resting value.
4. The _i<sub>FW</sub>_ current flank and its slow extinction results in a smooth
   evolution of the battery current and voltage of the _DC bus_ towards
   its new regime values.
   It's observed that **the voltage evolution is
   much smoother than when the _FESS_ is disabled** (natural).

![Step response](/static/images/voliner/step_response.svg)

### Pulse test

Let's analyze now the **system response to a _4A_ load pulse of
300ms duration**. The _FESS_ does not completely eliminate the
disturbance, but **reduces the amplitude of battery current
and _DC bus_ voltage variations by approximately 75%**.

![Pulse response](/static/images/voliner/pulse_response.svg)

## Conclusions

- The built system proved to have a **remarkable structural robustness**
  without the need to add external bearings, thus managing to maintain the
  levels of _energy loss_ by friction at _relatively low_ values.
- The **use of a _field oriented control_** (FOC) played an important role
  in the control of the _induction machine_.
  While it is often used to control speed or torque, it turned
  out to be _versatile and robust_ enough to **control the _power flow_**
  between the _FESS_ and the smart grid.
- With regard to the operation of the **_FESS_ as part of a smart grid**,
  the _hybridization of the energy storage_ achieved by introducing a second
  storage device significantly _reduced the presence of medium and high
  frequency components in the current_ circulating through the _battery bank_
  and in the _voltage_ of the _DC bus_. As a result, when there are abrupt
  changes in the smart grid load, these variables evolve smoothly towards
  their new steady-state value, **improving battery life and overall operation of
  the smart grid**.
- The **_FESS_ has a limitation in its _system response time_**.
  It cannot react fully in the first milliseconds after a disturbance. The
  response time is formed by the combination of the _electrical constants of
  the induction machine currents_ found in the most internal control
  loop and by the _control structure itself_. **Adding capacitors is an effective
  way to compensate this**.

  > The voltage disturbance
  > compensation time is between 5 and 10 times longer than the current
  > control response time because disturbance compensation is performed in a
  > loop outside the current control loop in a _cascading control_ scheme.
  > Having a
  > smaller ratio would cause _oscillations due to interference_ between control
  > loops and even _instability_.

- The broad **_DC bus_ voltage range** (240V-300V) introduced an additional
  degree of _complexity_ the system _dynamics_ depends on the voltage
  value. As a result, _PID regulators_ had to be adapted to
  perform properly across the smart grid _operating range_. The variation
  of this voltage also conditions the ability of the _i<sub>d</sub>_ and _i<sub>q</sub>_ current
  regulators to act, which results in a _limitation in the
  system power capacity_ (remember that _P=VxI_).
- The _self-discharge_ of the constructed _FESS_ is much _greater_ than that
  of its _commercial equivalents_ because those have several constructive
  advantages, the main ones being _magnetic levitation_ (which significantly
  reduces the losses present in the motor shaft bearings) and the _vacuum
  environment_ (which eliminates friction with air). This difference _doesn’t
  have a significant impact in the system dynamics_,
  so the **results obtained are valid
  and scalable to commercial _FESS_**. However, this has an impact on the
  energy consumption needed to keep the flywheel spinning at stand-by
  speed.
