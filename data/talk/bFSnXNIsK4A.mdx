## Introduction
This is an excellent talk by **Jonathan Boccara** from **CppCon 2018**. Jonathan's site [Fluent C++](https://www.fluentcpp.com/) has some resources mentioned in this talk. Not only this talk teaches ways to use the STL library, but also it shows many interesting algorithms that you might not know.


## 105 STL Algorithms
It's a good thing to know STL algorithms but not many people knows them all. This talk includes algorithms from C++17.

### Advantages
- They make the code more expressive.
- They avoid common mistakes.
- They are really efficient.
- They are used by a lot of people.
  - It's code tested very well.
  - It's a common language.

The most common one is `for_each` but there is so much more.

### There is a world of STL algorithms

You can get a high quality image of the map in [Fluent C++ - The World Map of C++ STL Algorithms](https://www.fluentcpp.com/getthemap/).

### Lands and Provinces
The map is divided in provinces which are groups of related algorithms. Many similarities can be found in them and this topological representation helps with learning and applying them.
#### Terminology
- Land: Group of algorithms that share a property.
- Province: Group of algorithms in a Land that share a closer relationship.

### Land of permutations
Elements move around the collection even if they don't change their value.

#### Province of Heaps
- make_heap
- push_heap
- pop_heap

#### Shore of Sorting
- sort
- sort_heap
- partial_sort
- nth_element
- inplace_merge


#### Region of Partitioning
- partition
- partition_point

#### Other Permutations
- rotate
- shuffle
- reverse
- next_permutation
- prev_permutation
- random_shuffle (kind of related)

#### Secret Runes

Combine them with other algorithms to create new ones. Including some algorithms from [Territory of Movers](#territory-of-movers), [Land of Value Modifiers](#land-of-value-modifiers), [Island of Structure Changers](#island-of-structure-changers) and [Peninsula of Raw Memory](#peninsula-of-raw-memory).
- stable_*
- *_copy
- *_if
- *_n
- is_*
- is_*__until

### Land of Queries
Extract some sort of value from a collection.

#### Province of Value Queries
Also called Numeric Algorithms.

- count
- accumulate
  - (transform_)reduce
- partial_sum
  - (transform_)inclusive_scan
  - (transform_)exclusive_scan
- inner_product
- adjacent_difference
- sample

#### Province of Property Queries

On 1 range
- all_of
- any_of
- none_of

#### Province of 2-Ranges Properties
On 2 ranges
- equal
- lexicographical_compare
- mismatch
- is_permutation

#### Province of Research

Value Searchers

- For not sorted
  - find
  - adjacent_find

- For sorted
  - equal_range
  - lower_bound
  - upper_bound
  - binary_search

<Image
  alt={`Searching a Value`}
  src={`/static/images/talk/bFSnXNIsK4A/searching_a_value.png`}
  width={1389}
  height={780}

Range Searchers
- search
- find_end
- find_first_of

<Image

  width={1386}
  height={781}
/>

Relative Value Searchers
- max_element
- min_element

### Glorious County of Algorithms on Sets
Any sorted collection can be considered a set.
- set_difference
- set_intersection
- set_union
- set_symetric_difference
- set_includes
- merge

### Territory of Movers
Move things around.
- copy
  - copy_backward
- move
  - move_backward
- swap_ranges

### Land of Value Modifiers
- fill
- iota
- generate
- replace

### Island of Structure Changers
Remember to erase the space of removed values.
- remove
- unique

### Lonely Islands
Not closely related to any others in particular.
- transform (can take 1 or 2 collections)
- for_each (mostly should be used for side effects)

### Peninsula of Raw Memory
Use the constructor operator (instead of the assignment operator like all the others).
- uninitialized_fill
- uninitialized_copy
- uninitialized_move
- destroy
- uninitialized_default_construct
- uninitialized_value_construct

## Next steps
- Use the STL algorithms to make your code more expressive.
- Replace your for-loops for the right algorithm.
- Go a step further by learning Boost algorithms.
