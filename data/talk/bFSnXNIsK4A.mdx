## Introduction
This is an excellent talk by **Jonathan Boccara** from **CppCon 2018**. Jonathan's site [Fluent C++](https://www.fluentcpp.com/) has some resources mentioned in this talk. Not only this talk teaches ways to use the STL library, but also it shows many interesting algorithms that you might not know.
All the algorithms mentioned in these notes have links to [C++ reference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/).

It's a good thing to know STL algorithms but not many people knows them all. This talk includes algorithms from C++17.

## Advantages
- They make the code more expressive.
- They avoid common mistakes.
- They are really efficient.
- They are used by a lot of people.
  - It's code tested very well.
  - It's a common language.

The most common one is `for_each` but there is so much more.

## There is a world of STL algorithms

You can get a high quality image of the map in [Fluent C++ - The World Map of C++ STL Algorithms](https://www.fluentcpp.com/getthemap/).

## Lands and Provinces
The map is divided in provinces which are groups of related algorithms. Many similarities can be found in them and this topological representation helps with learning and applying them.
### Terminology
- Land: Group of algorithms that share a property.
- Province: Group of algorithms in a Land that share a closer relationship.

## Land of permutations
Elements move around the collection even if they don't change their value.

- Replace your for-loops for the right algorithm.
- Go a step further by learning Boost algorithms.
