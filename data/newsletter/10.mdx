I've been trying to get back to writing, which led me to write not one, but **two** articles this update!

The first article talks about my recent freelance work building BeyondHQ's website.
I go over the requirements and technical decisions I made, as well as providing an example and some code snippets.

The second contains some quick thoughts on what it takes to be a good developer.
Spoiler alert: it's not about how good you are at coding. There's so, *so* much more to it. The best developers I've seen usually shine in different areas.
