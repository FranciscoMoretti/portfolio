It's been over a month since my last update, so I'm excited to share a bunch of new content. As always, feel free to reach out if you're curious to hear more about anything shared below.

## Updates

- [Next.js 10.1](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-10-1) was released with 3x faster refresh, 58% smaller install size, 56% less dependencies, WebAssembly Image Optimization, improved `next/image` support, and more. I can't believe Next.js is getting [20x faster](https://twitter.com/shuding_/status/1378086219708473344), with a real-time dev experience coming soon.
- I've previously shared my [Tweets page](https://leerob.io/tweets), which uses the [Twitter API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ9OzPQORtw) to statically generate all my tweets. I recently found a neat library called [react-static-tweets](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/react-static-tweets) which provides an NPM package for this.
- I love seeing what the community builds with Next.js. I was particularly impressed with this [Clubhouse clone using WebRTC](https://twitter.com/leeerob/status/1367958639361818624) and [WebSockets / Serverless demo](https://twitter.com/leeerob/status/1366799967088697344) with a chat application.
- If you're using Tailwind CSS, I highly recommend using to `v2.1` and using the [JIT engine](https://blog.tailwindcss.com/tailwindcss-2-1#jit-engine-in-core). This makes local development about 10x faster, especially with large projects.
- Next.js Commerce added [support for Shopify](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-10-1#nextjs-commerce-shopify-integration), which is pretty neat. Sanity has also created an [incredible e-commerce starter](https://hull.dev/) with Next/Vercel/Shopify.
- I created a demo showing how to [login with Touch ID on the web](https://twitter.com/leeerob/status/1373807407298674692)!

My favorite update is this [high-performance blog starter](https://demo.vercel.blog/) I created. It allows you to write posts in Markdown/MDX and automatically categorizes posts using tags. It has lots of goodies built-in: an RSS feed, optimized images and fonts, and more. Create your own with `npx create-next-app -e blog` ðŸš€

## New Videos

- [Let's Talk about Developer Careers](https://youtu.be/GCRRccGUYBM) â€“ Learn about my journey as a developer and how I've grown throughout my career. I also answer questions about hiring, growing in your career, and getting promoted!
- [Using Docker with Next.js (and Deploying with Google Cloud Run)](https://youtu.be/Pd2tVxhFnO4) â€“ Learn how to build, run, and deploy a Next.js application using Docker and Google Cloud Run in under 10 minutes.
- [Using Serverless Redis with Next.js](https://youtu.be/FytxaSVQROc) â€“ Learn how to deploy your own Redis & Next.js app in a few short minutes with Upstash and Vercel. It's also [available as a blog post](https://leerob.io/blog/serverless-redis-nextjs) if you prefer. The demo shown in the video is a [product feature roadmap](https://roadmap-redis.vercel.app/). Users can create/upvote features, which are ranked by their score.

I've also tried to clone a few websites, just for fun:

- [Tesla Clone](https://twitter.com/leeerob/status/1363337403314880515) â€“ This was a fun behind-the-scenes video as I tried to rebuild the car builder portion of [tesla.com](http://tesla.com) with Tailwind.
- [Netflix Clone](https://youtu.be/iJ_MiYEgDiM) â€“Â Per request from Twitter, watch live as I build a clone of the [Netflix.com](http://netflix.com/) landing page using Next.js, Tailwind (including the JIT engine), and `next-auth` to authenticate with Google.
- [Airbnb Clone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMRQgguzBLs) â€“ I joined a live stream with Contentful building an "Airbnb style" application with Contentful and Next.js. It turned out to be more of a great introduction to using Next.js with a CMS instead of _exactly_ like Airbnb.
