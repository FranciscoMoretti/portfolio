The past two months have been a whirlwind. If you missed [my last update](/newsletter/23), **I started a new job** as a Solutions Architect at [Vercel](https://vercel.com/about). It's been incredibly fun, rewarding, and challenging.

This job includes many firsts: my first time working at a startup, my first time working fully remote, and my first time involved with pre-sales. Each first has required me to adapt and grow. I'm still new to the role, but here are my thoughts so far.

Truly remote work is a blessing. Like, *the entire company is remote, no office remote* – not "pandemic" remote. It requires a fundamental culture shift from in-person to asynchronous communication. At Vercel, we use Notion. I rarely need to use email. Real-time communication happens in Slack, and everything else becomes async. The flexibility of working when *energized* and *engaged*, versus the slog of 9 to 5, is utterly refreshing.

The verdict is still out on missing the in-person experience. If we weren't currently in a pandemic, I'd probably be at some form of a coworking space. I'm looking forward to our company retreat when the world returns to normal.

### Highlights

Since my last update, I've been busy.

- Last week, we held the first Next.js global user conference. There were over 80,000 registrants, 39,000+ live attendees, and so many incredible speakers and sponsors. If you missed it, check out [Next.js Conf in 5 Minutes.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UK1zJLNHWrE)
- Some of the Conf announcements: [Next.js 10](https://nextjs.org/10), [Next.js Analytics](https://nextjs.org/analytics), and [Next.js Commerce](https://nextjs.org/commerce). Check out my [deep dive on Next.js Analytics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBIyEfdZYik).

- I joined James Quick on [his live stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH6dq3dcgCk) to talk about Next.js!
- For fun, I created a [fake MySpace page](https://myspace.leerob.io/) using Tailwind CSS ([source](https://github.com/leerob/myspace)).

Part of my job now includes creating examples for potential customers and clients. Here are a few you might find interesting:

### Closing Thoughts

My wedding reception is in three days. I'm beyond excited to celebrate my marriage with my favorite people in the world and take some well-needed time off on our honeymoon.
