2020 is off to a blazing start.
I've managed to write five articles, alongside shipping my course.

- [Iowa Caucuses Should Not Have Used an App](/blog/iowa-caucuses)
- [How to Use Encrypted Secrets with Vercel](https://vercel.com/support/articles/how-do-i-workaround-vercel-s-4-kb-environment-variables-limit)

## Mastering Next.js

My video course on Next.js & React calledÂ [**Mastering Next.js**](https://masteringnextjs.com/?ref=newsletter)Â has launched ðŸŽ‰

- 5,200 site views
- 500 product views
- 30 sales
- <strong>{'$1,911 ðŸ’¸'}</strong>

## Built a "personal dashboard"

I've started a new blog series showing how I built my ownÂ [personal dashboard](/dashboard)
using Next.js API routes + Vercel serverless functions.

- [Unsplash API](/blog/unsplash-api-nextjs)Â for views/downloads
- [YouTube API](/blog/youtube-api-nextjs)Â for views/subscribers
- Google Analytics API for page views

Bonus: UsesÂ [SWR](https://swr.now.sh/)Â to refresh stale content ðŸš€

## You don't need a two-page resume. Really.

As I moved into my new role a few months ago,
I went to update my resume â€“ That's when I realized it was terrible.

This prompted me to write a sort ofÂ [_resume retrospective_.](/blog/resume)
Basically, I just roast myself and my past resumes.
Hopefully, you can laugh at my mistakes and learn from my failures.

If you don't read the article,Â **here's what you need to know about your resume:**

- It should be easy to update and maintain.
- The font is readable, and there's a good use of bold and italic.
- Unnecessary information is omitted depending on your experience (e.g., GPA, internships).
- More relevant information is included (skills, freelance work).
- Industry normalized job title (Software Engineer III -> Senior Software Engineer).
- There are clear start/end dates in the same format throughout.
- Proper use of whitespace.
- Content is limited to one page. Cut out the cruft.
- The job title should be more prominent than the employer.
- You should be able to quickly parse the content at a glance.
- Include keywords to optimize for ATS
