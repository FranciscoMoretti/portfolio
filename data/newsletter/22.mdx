Over **200 amazing students** have pre-ordered the course and will be diving in today. Community members with early access had some nice things to say.

> "**React 2025 is really wonderful.** If you're struggling to figure out how to build Actual Webapps™ these days or have previously lost literal-months of your life trying to decipher Firebase, I highly recommend it." - [J.H. Gold](https://twitter.com/jongold)

It's been incredible watching students build their products alongside the course. [Anton Fenske](https://twitter.com/fenskexyz) has been building [DevSkills](https://devskills.co/) to deliver real-world techincal assessments. It also uses Tailwind CSS, which I love 😍

> "I was considering building a new SaaS application, but my lack of web development experience made me hesitant. Thankfully, I found React 2025. Walking through the streams with Lee and following his thought process every time he'd encounter a bug **fast-tracked my education.** My web app is already alive and kicking!" - [Anton Fenske](https://twitter.com/fenskexyz)
