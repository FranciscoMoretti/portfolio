Last year, I joined [Vercel](https://vercel.com) on a mission to grow the Next.js community. Today, I'm excited to share I've been promoted to **Head of Developer Relations at Vercel**.

I'm probably the most energized and optimistic I’ve been in my 10 years as a developer. I wrote a bit more on how I got here and some plans for the future on [my blog](/blog/head-of-devrel).

We also just announced a special [Next.js Conf](http://nextjs.org/conf) yesterday! Last year, over 40,000 people attended. There's _already_ 20,000 registrants this year. I can't wait.

That's the majority of this update. Here's a few other interesting things I've been working on:

- [Next.js 10.2](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-10-2) was released with performance improvements (faster builds, refresh, and startup), improved accessibility, Automatic Webfont Optimization, and more.
- I wrote [an article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/04/incremental-static-regeneration-nextjs/) and created [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrfuN_Hyd3Y) about Incremental Static Regeneration with Next.js.
- I also helped write an article about [Core Web Vitals](https://vercel.com/blog/core-web-vitals) building off a [conference talk of mine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SVe7TigqVg). These performance metrics will be influencing Google rankings next month, so it's good to keep up to date on them.

_P.S. If you want to join a high-growth startup, scale a community with millions of developers, and transform the way we build the web – [join me](https://vercel.com/careers)!_
