I'm really excited to share my new post entitled¬†[Purpose-Driven Work](/blog/purpose-driven-work/).
This topic has been on my mind for a while and I'm happy to finally get my thoughts down.
I touch on what purpose-driven work means to me and how I've found it working on Aisles Online at Hy-Vee.

I'm also really excited to share I've been invited to speak at the¬†[Talent42](https://www.talent42.com/)
conference in Seattle this summer!
I'll be joining other leaders from Facebook, Uber, Netflix, Atlassian,
and more to talk about how to recruit top engineers.
