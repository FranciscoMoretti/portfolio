Last month, I spoke at [Talent42 in Seattle](https://www.talent42.com/agenda/speakers/425777) about how
to recruit engineers during a 45-minute keynote. I'm happy to share it went well and the
talk has been posted on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chWOJB1LYkk).
I've also re-designed [my website](https://leerob.io).

**What's Next?**

I'm thrilled to continue speaking at [Prairie.Code()](https://prairiecode.amegala.com/Speakers) this September
and at the [Iowa Technology Summit](https://www.iowatechsummit.com/) in October.
Now that I've wrapped up work for [BeyondHQ](https://www.beyondhq.co/), I'm going to be exploring
some new project ideas and hopefully writing more!
