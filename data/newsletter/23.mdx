Big news â€“ I'm joining the incredible team at â–²[Vercel](https://vercel.com) as a Solutions Architect!

I'm incredibly excited to start this new chapter of my career. I've been a fan, customer, and advocate for Vercel over the past few years. Being able to join the team is surreal. Next.js has fundamentally changed how I build web applications, and I'm thrilled to help continue growing the thriving community.

One of the first initiatives I'll be helping tackle isÂ [Next.js Conf](https://nextjs.org/conf). As of this email, there are currently +34,000 attendees signed up. Hosting a remote conference at this scale will be a huge opportunity. We aim to craft the best remote conference possible, re-thinking what the overall experience looks like from the ground up.
