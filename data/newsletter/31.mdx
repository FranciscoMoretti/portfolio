We're more than halfway through 2021. Yet, I signed a check the other day as _2020_. And then I said next month was September. My internal calendar needs some work. Anyways...

It's been almost two months since my last update. I've been busy! I'm building a new house with my wife out in the country. And I'm also visiting San Francisco next week. We're having a team offsite, but let me know if you're local and interested in meeting up.

At Vercel, I've been focused on building the Developer Relations team. Our first Developer Advocate, [Delba](https://twitter.com/leeerob/status/1410957812528816133), started a few weeks ago and is already doing [an incredible job](https://twitter.com/leeerob/status/1417522652491747335). **Building a team is exciting**.

## Updates

- I was on the [Developer Experience podcast](https://twitter.com/algolia/status/1408084508549779465) from Algolia with Adam from Tailwind.
- I did an [AMA on tldr.tech](https://tldr.tech/ama/lee-robinson), a byte-sized tech newsletter.
- I wrote about [my journey to Software Engineering](/blog/career) and how I transitioned from designer to developer.
- I hosted a [live stream with PlanetScale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqBG5rFP4Ic), where they showed their serverless database workflow and how it integrates with Next.js and Vercel.
- I hosted another live stream showing how to use the [Notion API with Next.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlsGflZVIec).
- I did a deep dive comparing databases to find which was the fastest to deploy. [PlanetScale won with 10 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zmYHn82cY8). I compared AWS, Heroku, Firebase, Supabase, Railway, Nhost, GCP, Render, MongoDB, DigitalOcean, Upstash, and Fauna.

## Next.js Roundup

- We hosted a [special edition of Next.js Conf](https://vercel.com/blog/nextjs-special-event-recap) where we announced Next.js 11, Next.js Live, and I hosted the [after-party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANikp1R8zX8). Vercel also announced our [$102M Series C](https://twitter.com/rauchg/status/1407716317507948549).
- We're working on adding [full ES Modules](https://twitter.com/timneutkens/status/1414561271953989635) support.
- I wrote docs on adding [Layouts](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/layouts), [Security Headers](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/security-headers), and [Going to Production](https://nextjs.org/docs/going-to-production).
- We're exploring switching to [SWC](https://swc.rs), a compiler written with Rust.
