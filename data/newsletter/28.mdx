Hey everyone!

It reached a frigid -17Â°F (-27Â°C) yesterday in Iowa. Ouch. _On the bright side_, [more Americans have now received at least one dose of the Corona vaccine than have tested positive](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/) for the virus since the pandemic began. Here's to hoping life gets back to normal this year (unless you're reading this from New Zealand. I'm jealous).

A few updates:

- I published a comprehensive [article](https://leerob.io/blog/react-state-management) (and [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_o09PD_qAs)) on the Past, Present, and Future of React State Management. This expands on [my tweet](https://twitter.com/leeerob/status/1353523847937536000) with over 300k impressions (turns out people have strong opinions on Twitter ðŸ˜…) and should answer the question "Which state management library should I use with React?".
- My [10 Next.js Tips You Might Not Know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R59e1Vl5lO8) video (already 11k views ðŸ¤¯) was converted [into a blog post](https://vercel.com/blog/10-next-js-tips-you-might-not-know), if you prefer reading.
- I published a new article [Building Forms with Next.js](https://nextjs.org/blog/forms). You'll learn how to build a form with Next.js while reviewing best practices for HTML & React forms along the way!
- My personal site ([leerob.io](https://leerob.io/)) passed [1,000 stars on GitHub](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io) - so I did a [live code walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXQsF0q8KUg) of the repository and answered questions along the way. It uses Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and MDX.

**I'm excited to share my new YouTube live series.** I'll be chatting with friends about anything and everything: React, Vue, Svelte, WebGL, Accessibility, Design Systems, and non-tech too. The first two have already happened (_a bit slow_ on the newsletter update this time). I'll be sharing links to the streams on my Twitter, so [follow me there](https://twitter.com/leeerob) to join along live.
