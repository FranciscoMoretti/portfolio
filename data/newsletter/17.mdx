First, a few updates:

- I launched a new product called [jamstackfns](https://jamstackfns.com/). It's a collection of the best serverless functions for JAMstack applications. Overall, the launch [went smoothly](https://twitter.com/jamstackfns/status/1255153559273791493). I even managed to snag the [front page of Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23011702) for a bit.
- I posted a [new video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF6BvDyEcco) about where to host Next.js / Gatsby sites. I dive into the differences between Vercel's platform and Gatsby Cloud. I also touch on [Incremental Builds](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2020-04-22-announcing-incremental-builds) and discuss Next.js vs. Gatsby. It's about 11 minutes long.
- I've opened up my calendar for [20-minute virtual coffee sessions](https://calendly.com/leerobinson/coffee). It's an opportunity to get to know each other and chat about anything. I've joined a few other virtual coffee sessions this week and really enjoyed it.

**Today, I turn 27 🥳**

This [past year](/blog/2019) has been the most impactful of my life. Many milestones happened––from getting engaged to buying a home together. It hasn't always been easy.

Moving our wedding back due to COVID-19 was challenging, emotionally and logistically. I had to remind myself it could be much, much worse. I'm still getting married to the love of my life. I'm fortunate to have a job––especially one that allows me to work remotely. I'm thankful for the health of my family and friends during this pandemic. I'm lucky.

When I reflect on 26, it's hard to be upset. One of my favorite quotes sums it up well.

> “There are three things everyone should do every day. Number one is laugh. Number two is think––spend some time in thought. Number three, you should have your emotions move you to tears. If you laugh, think, and cry, that's a heck of a day.” ― Jim Valvano

I laughed. I thought. I cried. Most importantly, I lived. I didn't put my life on cruise control. I took every opportunity to step outside my comfort zone. Was I scared [speaking in front of a full auditorium in Seattle](/blog/how-to-fix-technical-recruiting)? Absolutely. Do I regret it? No.

Could I have saved more money? Sure. But that [two-week vacation in Italy](/blog/italy) with my fiancée is a memory I'll never forget. Retirement planning is like life insurance. It's nothing more than a hedge against the absolute worst-case scenario.

I tried to collect experiences and not things. I wanted to live in now, not someday. “Someday” is a disease that will take your dreams to the grave with you. I don't want to live a life of "what ifs".

What does my life at 27 look like? Ideally, more of the same. I’ll close this off with a reminder to hit reply and let me know what you think about any of this. If you've learned something from my site or course, I'd love to hear from you.

Cheers!
