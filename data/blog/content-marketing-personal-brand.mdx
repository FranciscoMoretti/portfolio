Have you ever Googled yourself? Based on your online footprint and the uniqueness of your name, you may or may not show up on the first page. What if there was a way to improve your online presence and build your personal brand?

### What Is Content Marketing?

One strategy to build your personal brand is called [content marketing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_marketing).

> Content marketing is a form of marketing focused on creating, publishing, and distributing content for a targeted audience online.

Typically, content marketing is used to attract and transform viewers into customers, but what if you're not selling anything?

You might not be explicitly selling a product, but you are **selling yourself**. You should view yourself as a business, and successful businesses usually have some form of marketing.

### Why Should I Use Content Marketing?

For me personally, I learn best by _doing_. I wanted to drive more content to my portfolio, but I wasn't sure how. I decided to put more focus on creating informative, high-quality content in the form of blog posts. The results have been pretty staggering.

After finishing my last post, [How Stripe Designs Beautiful Websites](/blog/how-stripe-designs-beautiful-websites), I posted a link to the article on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) and [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/).

I was immediately receiving 10x the traffic as before. The article ended up hitting #1 on Hacker News and [/r/web_design](https://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/).

This ultimately led to the article being reposted across a bunch of different websites. It continued to grow organically throughout the day, bringing in ~70,000 views in 24 hours.

This traffic created two notable events:

- My average site traffic doubled
- My portfolio moved from the 3rd page of Google to the 1st

You might be thinking "That's great Lee, but would it work for me?"

### How Can I Do It?

Okay, by now I've convinced you this is a good idea. But how do you actually go about _doing_ it?

I'll start by addressing the most difficult part: **You have to be authentic**. You're creating an online identity for yourself. It needs to be _your_ great ideas and thoughts. You can't write some half-assed article you threw together at 2 AM and didn't proofread. You're trying to build trust with the reader.

You need to produce **high-quality content**. You can't write one paragraph and call it good. You have to provide value to your readers. So how do you produce high-quality content?

1.  Research the subject matter and become very familiar with it. You should be educating your readers.
2.  Tell stories with your articles. Make your readers connect with you.
3.  Use humor when appropriate üòÑ
4.  Include pictures. They're worth 1000 words, remember?
5.  Optimize your article for social media. Read about [meta tags](http://www.wordstream.com/meta-tags) and [open graph](http://ogp.me/).
6.  Don't waste their time - Make your articles concise but still informative.

### Share Your Content

After you've created some content you're proud of, you should:

- Proofread it, and then proofread it again.
- Utilize a tool like [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) to help prevent spelling issues.
- Share it on social media and any other industry-specific communities.
- Send emails to connect with influencers.
- Be active and respond to readers questions and inquiries.
