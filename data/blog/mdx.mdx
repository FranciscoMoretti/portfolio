I recently decided to redesign and revamp my site. I had a few main goals:

1. Easier content management for blog posts
1. Simplified, minimal design
1. Dark mode support

## Simplified Design

Before this redesign, I hand-rolled all of my components using [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/).
I was trying to maintain a consistent design, so I'd extract shared values out into a theme.

```js
export const colors = {
  accent: '#ff5252',
  background: '#0a6159',
  border: '#dcdcdc',
  grey: {
      100: '#F5F7FA',
      200: '#E4E7EB',
      300: '#CBD2D9',
      400: '#9AA5B1',
      500: '#7B8794',
      600: '#616E7C',
      700: '#52606D',
      800: '#3E4C59',
      900: '#323F4B',
      1000: '#1F2933'
  },
  light: '#606060',
  text: '#101010'
};

export const spacing = {
  extrasmall: '0.5em',
  small: '1em'
  normal: '1.5em',
  large: '2em',
  extralarge: '2.5em',
};
```

Front-end tooling has rapidly progressed, and projects like [styled-system](https://styled-system.com/) and [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com/) make it easy
to create components that easily adhere to your design system.

My site isn't anything crazy â€“ mostly a few simple static pages and blog posts. While coding everything myself is a
fun learning experience, there are plenty of component libraries that contain everything necessary to achieve the
design I was aiming for. That's why I chose to adopt [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) for my redesign.

- It uses styled-system under the hood, allowing me to use style props
- The theme is extendable, allowing me to change fonts and add icons easily
- It includes a great set of accessible components out of the box
- Works well with Next.js and supports dark mode

Here's a quick example of Chakra UI and styled-system. This is part of the source for
the newsletter subscription at the bottom of this post.

```js:components/Subscribe.js
<Box
  border="1px solid"
  borderColor="blue.200"
  bg="blue.50"
  borderRadius={4}
  padding={6}
  my={4}
>
  <Heading as="h5" size="lg" mb={2}>
    Subscribe to the newsletter
  </Heading>
  <Text>
    Get emails from me about web development, tech, and early access to new
    articles.
  </Text>
  <InputGroup size="md" mt={4}>
    <Input
      aria-label="Email for newsletter"
      placeholder="tim@apple.com"
      type="email"
    />
    <InputRightElement width="6.75rem">
      <Button fontWeight="bold" h="1.75rem" size="sm">
        Subscribe
      </Button>
    </InputRightElement>
  </InputGroup>
</Box>
```

Using [style props](https://styled-system.com/getting-started), I'm able to easily style my components while pulling values directly from
my design system. For example, `mb` (short for `margin-bottom`) of `2` will translate to `0.5rem` or `~8px`.

> **Update 2020:** I've [switched to Tailwind](/blog/tailwind) now.

## Improved Content Management

I wanted to decrease the amount of friction it took to create new articles,
as well as improve maintainability over time.

Previously, I maintained a JSON file containing all my articles.

```js:data/articles.json
export default [
  {
    date: 'February 24, 2020',
    slug: 'fetching-data-with-swr',
    title: 'Create a Dashboard with Next.js API Routes - Fetching Data with SWR'
  },
  {
    date: 'February 18, 2020',
    slug: 'google-analytics-api-nextjs',
    title: 'Create a Dashboard with Next.js API Routes - Google Analytics API'
  }
];
```

Then, I iterated over this list to display all articles when viewing `leerob.io/blog`.
This approach worked, but it meant that I had two sources of truth.

Each `.mdx` blog post already contained this information, as well as other metadata passed to `<Post />`.
Every time I added a new article, I had to change two places.

```js
export const meta = {
  date: '2019-12-26',
  description: 'Highlights and reflections on 2019 and a look forward to 2020.',
  image: '/static/images/2019/banner.jpg',
  slug: '2019',
  title: '2019 Year in Review'
};

export default ({ children }) => <Post meta={meta}>{children}</Post>;
```

I decided to use Markdown front matter instead. Now, each `.mdx` file has a top section like this:

```js
title: '2019 Year in Review';
publishedAt: '2019-12-26';
summary: 'Highlights and reflections on 2019 and a look forward to 2020.';
image: '/static/images/2019/banner.jpg';
```

Now, I can use native Next.js functionality like `getStaticProps` and `getStaticPaths` to fetch my MDX content:

```js:pages/blog/[slug].js
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const posts = await getFiles('blog');

  return {
    paths: posts.map((p) => ({
      params: {
        slug: p.replace(/\.mdx/, '')
      }
    })),
    fallback: false
  };
}

export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  const post = await getFileBySlug('blog', params.slug);

  return { props: { ...post } };
}
```

> **Update 2021:** I've moved to [mdx-bundler](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler).

## MDX Plugins

`mdx-bundler` allows you to extend [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) and [rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype), providing external plugins to hook into the compilation process. Some plugins I've added:

- [rehype-slug](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-slug)
- [rehype-code-titles](https://github.com/josestg/rehype-code-title)
- [rehype-autolink-headings](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-autolink-headings)
- [rehype-prism-plus](https://github.com/timlrx/rehype-prism-plus)

```js:lib/mdx.js
import { join } from 'path';
import { readFileSync } from 'fs';
import { bundleMDX } from 'mdx-bundler';
import readingTime from 'reading-time';

import rehypeSlug from 'rehype-slug';
import rehypeCodeTitles from 'rehype-code-titles';
import rehypeAutolinkHeadings from 'rehype-autolink-headings';
import rehypePrism from 'rehype-prism-plus';

export async function getFileBySlug(type, slug) {
  const source = readFileSync(join(process.cwd(), 'data', type, `${slug}.mdx`), 'utf8');
  const { code, frontmatter } = await bundleMDX(source, {
    xdmOptions(options) {
      options.rehypePlugins = [
        ...(options?.rehypePlugins ?? []),
        rehypeSlug,
        rehypeCodeTitles,
        rehypePrism,
        [
          rehypeAutolinkHeadings,
          {
            properties: {
              className: ['anchor']
            }
          }
        ]
      ];
      return options;
    }
  });

  return {
    code,
    frontMatter: {
      wordCount: source.split(/\s+/gu).length,
      readingTime: readingTime(source),
      slug: slug || null,
      ...frontmatter
    }
  };
}
```

This added some nice additional features:

- Hover over a heading and click on `#` to link directly to it.
- Use `language:title` to add titles to code snippets.
- [Reading time](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reading-time) of articles.

## Better Syntax Highlighting

Previously, I directly imported a `prism.css` theme alongside `react-syntax-highlighter` to provide syntax highlighting.
This approach did not allow me to easily change styles based on the theme. Thus, I kept the code style always dark.

Instead, I switched to [rehype-prism-plus](https://github.com/Val-istar-Guo/rehype-prism)
and created two prism themes for dark/light mode. `rehype-prism-plus` also adds line highlighting capabilities ðŸŽ‰

```js:styles/prism.js
import { css } from '@emotion/react';
import { theme } from '@chakra-ui/react';

const prismBaseTheme = css`
  // Base styling
`;

export const prismLightTheme = css`
  // Light mode
`;

export const prismDarkTheme = css`
  // Dark mode
`;
```

```js:_app.js
const { colorMode } = useColorMode();
const prismTheme = colorMode === 'light' ? prismLightTheme : prismDarkTheme;
```

> **Update 2020:** I've [switched to Tailwind](/blog/tailwind) now and use the native Dark Mode support.

## Summary

Outside of my main goals, I was able to sneak in some other fun additions:

- Show [view counts](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io/blob/91233631f0e1a193295ffc54d2291f3109060007/components/BlogPost.tsx) for all blog posts, dynamically pulled from Firebase
- Faster page load times
- Switched to [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) as my main font
- Fewer files, and a _lot_ of deleted code!

The best part? [**It's all open source**](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io) ðŸš€
