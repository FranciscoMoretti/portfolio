A critical step in freelance development is assessing your client's business problem and finding the best technology to solve it. "Best" could mean a variety of things depending on the client: cheap, fast, robust, future-proof, or industry standard. This post will outline how I assessed a business problem, chose the "best" technology, and delivered a timely solution to my client.

[BeyondHQ](https://beyondhq.co/) is an early-stage startup that helps companies expand outside of San Francisco. Think "Expansion-as-a-Service" - finding the right city, opening an office, growing your team, etc. They needed a basic website explaining who, what, and why - as well as a platform to build their SaaS solutions on top of. That's where I came in.

## The Requirements

For the main website, the requirements were fairly straight forward:

- Basic splash page with information about the product.
- About page with information on the employees.
- Frequently asked questions page.
- Save off information from a contact form.
- Cheap hosting. Ideally free.

They also wanted a platform to build SaaS on. That meant I needed to consider more requirements, as it would be the next bit of functionality I would create.

The first step towards their full-featured SaaS product was a [location evaluation tool](https://beyondhq.co/geo-eval). Users could enter information like their company size, the number of employees, and potential expansion locations to get a list of their top city matches. Then, they could explore each city and see metrics about what made it an attractive option to expand to. Those requirements were a bit more complex:

- Resilient, highly available, and fast.
- Cheap storage. Ideally free.
- Great SEO (Search Engine Optimization).
- City pages should be dynamic and pull from a database.
- The ability for non-technical people to easily edit data.
- Save off lead generation information from user input.

## The Technology

Given these requirements, what technical choices did I make and why? Let's take a look.

### React

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is the industry-standard for building modern web applications. Of 90,000 developers [surveyed by Stack Overflow](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019), React was the most loved and most wanted. This technology provides a platform for the main website, as well as any future SaaS.

### Next.js

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) makes it easy to build scalable, performant React code. It's blazing fast and uses server-side rendering to improve SEO. On top of that, it simplifies the developer experience and provides a future-proof platform for the BeyondHQ team.

### Vercel

Deploying serverless applications couldn't be easier with [Vercel](https://vercel.com). It's resilient, [highly available](https://vercel.com/smart-cdn), and fault-tolerant. Plus, it has an excellent [free tier](https://vercel.com/pricing) with the ability to scale as needed.

### Firebase

[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) is the industry standard [NoSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL) platform. It has a sufficient user/permissions system and an easy interface for non-technical users. Did it mention it has a generous [free tier](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)? Firebase's [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore/) product allowed us to save off contact info, city information, and user's lead gen input. It was a no-brainer!

Why use NoSQL? There weren't any requirements which needed a relational database. If there were, I might have considered [Postgres on Hasura](https://hasura.io/) instead.

## The Solution

After reviewing the requirements and choosing the technology, the next step was to begin implementing a solution. But first, mockups!

I iterated over a handful of designs and went back and forth with the team, tweaking things based on their feedback. We eventually agreed on a mockup and the coding commenced.

### API Route

To use Firebase, we need to create an [API route](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction).
This will allow us to use `firebase-admin` to communicate with our Cloud Firestore database.

**Note:** You need to generate and download a service account in Firebase.

```js:lib/firebase.js
import admin from 'firebase-admin';

if (!admin.apps.length) {
  admin.initializeApp({
    credential: admin.credential.cert({
      project_id: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID,
      private_key: process.env.FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY,
      client_email: process.env.FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL
    }),
    databaseURL: 'YOUR_DATABASE_URL_HERE'
  });
}

export default admin.firestore();
```

```js:pages/api/city/[name].js
import firebase from '../../../lib/firebase';

export default (req, res) => {
  firebase
    .collection('cities')
    .doc(req.query.name)
    .get()
    .then((doc) => {
      res.json(doc.data());
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      res.json({ error });
    });
};
```

Let's break this down.

- A request is made to `/api/city/des-moines`
- A connection to Firestore is created with your service account
- We query the `cities` collection
- `req.query.name` has the [dynamic route](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes) value of `des-moines`
- We return the data for that document

### The Client

For each city, we want to pass the name as a route (e.g. `/city/des-moines`) and fetch data from our API.
Let's create `pages/city/[name].js` using [dynamic routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes) and [SWR](/blog/fetching-data-with-swr).

```js:/pages/city/[name].js
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';
import useSWR from 'swr';

const fetcher = async (...args) => {
  const res = await fetch(...args);

  return res.json();
};

function City() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { name } = router.query;
  const { data } = useSWR(`/api/city/${name}`, fetcher);

  if (!data) {
    return 'Loading...';
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Population: {data.population}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default City;
```

This gives you the flexibility to add a loading state or placeholder to improve your user experience.

Much better! ðŸŽ‰
