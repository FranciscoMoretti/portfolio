Data is a beautiful thing. Especially when we can sort, organize, and manipulate it to our needs. In this post, I’m going to walk you through harnessing the power of the Google Places, Yelp, and Foursquare APIs to create a list of businesses in your area.

## Development

Let’s create a Business model to represent the data we’ll retrieve from our sources. Most of the parameters to create a Business are pretty straight forward. If you’re comparing businesses between data sources, you’ll find that the naming conventions aren’t equal. To alleviate this issue, you can use the address as a constant between the businesses. You could also add other attributes to suit your needs, like a phone number or website link.

```python
class Business:
  def __init__(self, name, address, rating,
			   rating_count, checkin_count):
	self.name = name
	self.address = address
	self.rating = rating
	self.rating_count = rating_count
	self.checkin_count = checkin_count
```

We’ll be using the urllib2 library to make HTTP requests. Let’s create a helper function to reduce repeated code.

```python
def make_request(url):
	with closing(urlopen(url)) as response:
		return json.loads(response.read())
return data
```

I’ll be focusing on explaining code snippets in the following section. If you’d like to jump straight to the completed code, here’s the [link](https://github.com/leerob/Guesstimator).

```python
def make_request(url):
	with closing(urlopen(url)) as response:
		return json.loads(response.read())
return data
```

## APIs

### Foursquare

Before diving in, we must first obtain our client keys to access the [API](https://developer.foursquare.com/). You can find those [here](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/) after creating an application. Next, let’s look at the different endpoints we can access. The [explore](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/venues/explore) endpoint allows us to find venues around a given location. This endpoint contains venue rating information as well as check-in counts.

```python
https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/explore
```

Let’s give it some parameters to narrow our search:

- ll: Latitude and longitude of the user’s location.
- radius: Search radius in meters.
- categoryId: Limit results to a specific category (e.g. “bars”).

Combining these parameters with our client keys, we can make a request to our newly created URL and retrieve a list of venues:

```python
venue_list = []
try:
	data = make_request(url)
for item in data['response']['groups'][0]['items']:
	venue = item['venue']
	venue_list.append(Business(
		venue['name'],
		venue['location']['address'],
		venue['rating'],
		venue['ratingSignals'],
		venue['stats']['checkinsCount']))
except Exception, e:
	print e
```

After receiving our JSON response, we can iterate through the dictionary to create our array of Business objects containing our desired information.

### Yelp

Following suite with Foursquare, we must first obtain our consumer keys before we can access the [API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/overview). You can find those [here](https://www.yelp.com/login?return_url=%2Fdevelopers%2Fmanage_api_keys) after logging in. I tried to refrain from using [external libraries](https://github.com/yelp/yelp-python) to reduce installation requirements, but ultimately ended up needing [rauth](https://rauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
To install simply run:

```python
pip install rauth
```

We’ll be using the [Search API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api) to obtain a list of businesses in our area.

```python
https://api.yelp.com/v2/search
```

Once again, let’s give the URL some parameters to narrow our search:

- ll: Latitude and longitude of the user’s location.
- radius_filter: Search radius in meters. Max distance 40000 meters.
- term: Limit results to a specific category (e.g. “bars”).

To obtain our desired information, we first need to create an authenticated session. Next, we make a request to our newly created URL and once again parse the JSON response.

```python
session = rauth.OAuth1Session(
	consumer_key = CONSUMER_KEY,
	consumer_secret = CONSUMER_SECRET,
	access_token = TOKEN,
	access_token_secret = TOKEN_SECRET)

request = session.get(url, params=params)
data = request.json()
session.close()
business_list = []
for business in data['businesses']:
	address = business['location']['display_address'][0]
	business_list.append(Business(
		business['name'],
		address,
		business['rating'],
		business['review_count'],
		'N/A'))
```

### Google Places

You’ve got the hang of this now, right? Obtain the [keys](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/get-api-key), read the [documentation](https://developers.google.com/places/), and find our [endpoint](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/search).

```python
pip install rauth
```

We’ll be using the [Search API](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/search) to obtain a list of businesses in our area.

```python
https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/nearbysearch/json?params
```

We need to supply these parameters:

- location: Latitude and longitude of the user’s location.
- radius: Search radius in meters. Max distance 50000 meters.
- type: Limit results to a specific category (e.g. “bars”).

```python
place_list = []
try:
	data = make_request(url)
	for result in data['results']:
		place = search_google_place(result['place_id'])
		place_list.append(place)
except Exception, e:
  print e
```

We’ll need to make a request to an individual place using a new URL.

```python
https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/details/json?placeid=id
```

Finally, we’ll once again parse the JSON result and retrieve the places.

```python
try:
	data = make_request(url)
	place = data['result']
	return Business(
		place['name'],
		place['formatted_address'].split(',')[0],
		place['rating'],
		place['user_ratings_total'],
		'N/A')
except Exception, e:
  print e
```

> Congratulations! You’ve successfully retrieved all your local businesses from Foursquare, Yelp and Google.

Now that you’ve obtained a list of Business objects, you’re free to manipulate the data as you please. I chose to leverage the ratings to create a better ranking system for bars in my area, but the possibilities are endless.
