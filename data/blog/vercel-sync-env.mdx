## Pull the ENV variables from a Vercel project using the CLI
I used to copy-paste my ENV variables from the hosting. More often than not a tiny error caused the whole application to fail, especially when working with keys.

Today I've learned that [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) CLI allows you to pull all the ENV variables from your project. I'll never fill that file manually again!

## How to do it
I'll show you how to do it by sharing the steps I've applied to a new project I'm working on called `cheese-store`.

### Install the Vercel CLI globally
Vercel is my main hosting solution for new projects, so I just installed the CLI globally.
```bash
npm i -g vercel
```

### Link to your repository
Simply run `vercel link` and follow the steps from the CLI to link your local repository with your vercel project. This is what the output looked like for me.
```bash
>> fran@tpx1:~/code/cheese-store$ vercel link
Vercel CLI 24.1.0
> > No existing credentials found. Please log in:
> Log in to Vercel github
> Success! GitHub authentication complete for your_mail_address@mail_provider.com
? Set up “~/code/cheese-store”? [Y/n] y
? Which scope should contain your project? Francisco Moretti
? Found project “franciscomoretti/cheese-store”. Link to it? [Y/n] y
✅  Linked to franciscomoretti/cheese-store (created .vercel)
```

### Pull the ENV variables
Now that Vercel is linked you can download the ENV variables just by running `vercel env pull`.
```bash
>> fran@tpx1:~/code/cheese-store$ vercel env pull
Vercel CLI 24.1.0
Downloading Development Environment Variables for Project cheese-store
✅  Created .env file [492ms]
```
You can also add a new variable with another commands. Check the documentation for [Vercel CLI env](https://vercel.com/docs/cli#commands/env).

### The result
And just like that, all the environment variables were created and completed in my local repository. Pretty cool, right?
