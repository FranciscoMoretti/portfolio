## Set up a development environment with
- VS Code
- An Ubuntu distribution in WSL2
- Node Version Manager (Node and npm)
- Windows Terminal
- A Next.js example

### Windows Requirements
This tuturial was created in Windows 11 but you can use any of the following Windows versions:
- Windows 10 version 2004 and higher (Build 19041 and higher)
- Windows 11.

## VS Code
### Download and install 
Simply download it from the [official site](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and follow the install instructions.

### Remote - WSL extenision
You'll also need to install the [Remote-WSL extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl) for a future step.

To install an extension open the extension pannel with `ctrl+shift+X`. Search `Remote - WSL` and hit install.

## Windows Terminal
Windows Terminal is a modern host application for the command-line shell. Basically it allows you to run commands in Windows. 
Open the Terminal by typing `Terminal` in the search bar.

## WSL2
### Why WSL2?
The Windows subsystem for Linux has the following advantages:
- You get the hardware support of Windows and the software flexibility of Linux.
- The integration between Windows and Linux is impressive. Very few steps are required to set it up.
- It has great performance to run web applications.
- Most servers run linux and you want to develop and test in a similar system.
- It keeps your host OS clean. You'll install most development dependencies in the WSL2 envionment.

### Install an Ubuntu distribution with WSL 
To install an Ubuntu distribution in WSL2 simply run the following command in PowerShell.
```PowerShell:PowerShell
wsl --install
```
For additional resources check [this website](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

After a few minutes you should be able to open it in a new Terminal tab.
**You will need to do a few setup steps the first time you run your WSL2 Ubuntu distribution, just follow the instructions that appear in the Ubuntu bash tab.**

### Set up NVM in Ubuntu
Now paste the following commands in the Ubuntu bash tab and that should set up node with its version manager.
```Bash:Bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y

## Install nvm and node
## nvm
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash

## node
nvm install --lts
```

## Run a Next.js application
Let's run a Next.js application to verify that everything is working and get a Next.js project started at the same time.

### Create next app
Since this is a new setup, you'll need to install `create-next-app`, but jus trying to use it for the first time will run the installation as well. Create a new application and name it `blog-app` by running the following line.

```Bash:Bash
npx create-next-app@latest blog-app
```
You should see something like this once it's done.

  height={438}
/>


### Open with VS Code
Now we can open this with VS Code and close the circle. Let's tell VS Code to open the `blog-app` folder. This will install VS Code remote server and it will also open the folder directly in VS Code in Windows.

```Bash:Bash
code blog-app
```

The result should look like the following screenshot. Note the `WSL:Ubuntu` at the bottom left corner indicating that VS Code is connected to that WSL distribution.

/>

### Running the app
You can now use VS Code terminal instead of the Windows terminal. To open the VS Code terminal use `ctrl+\``.

First, install the dependencies
```Bash:Bash
npm install
```
Then, run the server
```Bash:Bash
npm run dev
```
Your VS Code terminal should should indicate that the application is running now.

  alt={`App started in VS Code`}
  src={`/static/images/web-dev-in-windows-11/vs_code_app_started.png`}
  width={1024}
  height={768}
/>

Your application should have started in http://localhost:3000/ in Windows now and you should be able to access it with any browser.

## Conclusion
This is a tutorial that set up many different tools. From Windows, to Linux though VS Code and through the Terminal. You end up with a Next.js blog application from one of the hottests framworks at the moment and with a clean setup to create other applications.

If you want to keep learning Next.js you can use the tools from this post to try one of the [many official examples](https://nextjs.org/examples).
