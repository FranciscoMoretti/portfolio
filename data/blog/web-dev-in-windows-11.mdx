## Install VS Code
Simply download it from the [official site](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and follow the install instructions.

## Windows Terminal
Windows Terminal is a modern host application for the command-line shell. Basically it allows you to run commands in Windows. 
Open the Terminal by typing `Terminal` in the search bar.

## WSL2 
Windows subsystem for linux has the following advantages:
- You get the hardware support of Windows and the software flexibility of Linux.
- It's now mature enough to be used comfortably. The integration between Windows and Linux is impressive.
- It has great performance to run web applications.
- Most servers run linux and WSL2 lets you develop and test in a similar system.
- It keeps your host OS clean. You'll install development dependencies in the WSL2 envionment.


To install an Ubuntu distribution in WSL2 simply run the following command in PowerShell.
```PowerShell:PowerShell
wsl --install
```
