While exploring the [Gumroad API](https://gumroad.com/api) for my [personal dashboard](/dashboard),
I struggled to find any examples using Node.js. Yes, there was a cURL example.

```http
curl https://api.gumroad.com/v2/products/sDpG \
  -d "access_token=ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -X GET
```

However, [converting that](https://kigiri.github.io/fetch/) into a `fetch` was not working as I'd expect.

```js
fetch('https://api.gumroad.com/v2/products/sDpG', {
  body: 'access_token=ACCESS_TOKEN',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
  },
  method: 'POST'
});
```

First, I was getting a `404` because it was expecting a `GET` instead of `POST`.
Then, I got a `401` since the authorization was incorrect. After a bit of fumbling,
I was able to get the Gumroad API working with Node.js. Here's an example fetching
information about a specific product.

```js:pages/api/gumroad.js
export default async (_, res) => {
  const API_KEY = process.env.GUMROAD_API_KEY;
  const response = await fetch(`https://api.gumroad.com/v2/products/sDpG`, {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${API_KEY}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    method: 'GET'
  });

  const { product } = await response.json();
  const sales = product.sales_usd_cents / 100;

  return res.status(200).json({ sales });
};
```

Here's another example fetching all of the sales for a user.

```js
let url = '/v2/sales';
const allSales = [];
const API_KEY = process.env.GUMROAD_API_KEY;

while (url) {
  const response = await fetch(`https://api.gumroad.com${url}`, {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${API_KEY}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    method: 'GET'
  });

  const { sales, next_page_url: nextPageUrl } = await response.json();

  allSales.push(sales);

  if (nextPageUrl) {
    url = nextPageUrl;
  } else {
    break;
  }
}

return res.status(200).json({ sales: allSales });
```

The first example allowed me to fetch my total sales and display it on my dashboard. Hooray! ðŸŽ‰
