For many teams using Next.js, setting up exception monitoring is a critical requirement before going to production.
This guide will show you how to use [Sentry](https://sentry.io) to catch & report errors on both client and server-side.

## Brief Next.js Overview

Next.js gives you a [hybrid approach](https://vercel.com/blog/nextjs-server-side-rendering-vs-static-generation) for rendering your application.
You can choose on a per-page basis whether you want client-side rendering, server-side rendering, or static-site generation.

Next.js uses [file system based routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/introduction).
All files inside the `/pages` directory will be routed based on their filename (e.g. `/pages/home.js` routes to `your-domain.com/home`).

There are a few Next-specific files you should understand:

- `_app.js` is used to initialize pages and renders on both the client and the server.
- `_error.js` is rendered by Next.js while handling exceptions.
- `next.config.js` allows you to override the default configuration.

## Implementing Sentry

> **Update (2021):** This guide has been replaced with the [official Sentry + Next.js example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-sentry).
