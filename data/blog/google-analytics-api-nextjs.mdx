<Analytics />

## Overview

Google Analytics is, by far, the most popular analytics platform. In this post, we'll look at how
we can retrieve the number of page views in a specific time range programmatically.

If you're more concerned about privacy, you might consider using [Fathom Analytics](https://usefathom.com/ref/T93GOJ) or [SimpleAnalytics](https://simpleanalytics.com/).

**Note:** You'll need to turn off your ad blocker for this page to work.

## Getting Access to Google Analytics

To gain access to the Google Analytics API, you need to:

- Go to the [Google Developer Console.](https://console.developers.google.com/)
- Create a new project.
- Credentials -> Create Credentials -> Service-account key.
- Click “Enable APIs and services.”
- Find "Google Analytics API" and enable it.

Since we're communicating server-to-server, we'll need a [service account](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2ServiceAccount).

- Go to your [service accounts](https://console.developers.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts) page.
- Create a service account.
- Click "Create Key" and choose JSON.

You should now have a JSON file similar to this:

```json
{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "...",
  "private_key_id": "...",
  "private_key": "...",
  "client_email": "...",
  "client_id": "...",
  "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
  "token_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token",
  "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
  "client_x509_cert_url": "..."
}
```

We use this key later to set up our client in our API Route.
Okay, back to the [service account](https://console.developers.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts).
We need to delegate [domain-wide authority](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2ServiceAccount#delegatingauthority).

- On the table row, click Actions -> Edit.
- Show Domain-Wide Delegation -> Enable G-Suite Domain-Wide Delegation.

Finally, we need to add our service account email to the Google Analytics account we want to use.

- Go to the Admin panel inside Google Analytics.
- Click "User Management."
- Add the `client_email` from your service account.

**That's it!** 🎉 You now have access to make requests to the Google Analytics API with your service account.

## Creating an environment variable

To securely access the API, we need to include the secret with each request.
We also _do not_ want to commit secrets to git. Thus, we should use an environment variable.

Since I'm deploying with [Vercel](https://vercel.com), I can add the secrets via their CLI.
We only need a few of the values from the JSON file. For the private key, make sure you convert
the new line characters (`\n`) to actual new lines.

```bash
$ vc secret add -- google-private-key "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
MIIEvQIBA
..
..
2DAVOW4c=
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----"
$ vc secret add google-client-email my-account@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
$ vc secret add google-client-id 721877721877
```

To reference these values locally when using `vc dev`, they need to be added to your `.env` file.

```bash
GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nDVOW4c=\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL=my-account@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

Finally, we need to add the secrets to our `vercel.json`.

```json:vercel.json
{
  "env": {
    "GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY": "@google-private-key",
    "GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL": "@google-client-email"
  }
}
```

We can now reference the secrets via `process.env.GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY` in our API route.

**Note:** If you have a lot of environment variables in Vercel, you might need to [encrypt your service account](https://vercel.com/support/articles/how-do-i-workaround-vercel-s-4-kb-environment-variables-limit).

## Creating the API Route

Let's start by creating a new API route at `pages/api/page-views.js`.

```js
export default (req, res) => {
  return res.status(200).json({});
};
```

To make server-side requests to Google Analytics, we can install the [googleapis](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-nodejs-client) library.

```bash
$ yarn add googleapis@48.0.0
```

Then, we can initialize `googleapis` inside our API route.

```js
import { google } from 'googleapis';

let googleAuth;

export default async (_, res) => {
  googleAuth = new google.auth.GoogleAuth({
    credentials: {
      client_email: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL,
      private_key: process.env.GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY
    },
    scopes: ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/analytics.readonly']
  });

  const analytics = google.analytics({
    auth,
    version: 'v3'
  });

  return res.status(200).json({});
};
```

Finally, we want to pull statistics about our site. We'd like to know the total number of views for a given time range.
To allow the API route to be re-used, let's pass the start date as a query parameter.

```js
const startDate = req.query.startDate;
```

Then, we can use the same API route to fetch stats about different time ranges.

```js
import { google } from 'googleapis';

let googleAuth;

export default async (_, res) => {
  googleAuth = new google.auth.GoogleAuth({
    credentials: {
      client_email: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL,
      private_key: process.env.GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY
    },
    scopes: ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/analytics.readonly']
  });

  const analytics = google.analytics({
    auth,
    version: 'v3'
  });

  const startDate = req.query.startDate;
  const response = await analytics.data.ga.get({
    'end-date': 'today',
    ids: 'ga:186371021',
    metrics: 'ga:pageviews',
    'start-date': startDate
  });

  return res.status(200).json({
    pageViews: response.data.rows[0][0]
  });
};
```

## Example

_Bonus_: You can cache the API route with the [cache-control](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control) header.

```bash
Cache-Control: public, max-age=120, stale-while-revalidate=60
```
