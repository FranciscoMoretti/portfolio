I recently switched my Continuous Integration ([CI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration))
provider from [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) to [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).
My primary use for CI is running linting/tests on every pull request. Nothing too crazy.

I've used CircleCI as my go-to provider for a while now. When I'm trying to get a project off the ground,
I don't want to worry about reinventing the wheel every time I need to set up CI.

GitHub recently came out with Actions, which appeared to solve the same problem without relying on an external service.
Then, there was a [security incident](https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034852194-Security-Incident-on-8-31-2019-Details-and-FAQs-) with CircleCI on August 31st.
I decided to sign up for the beta of GitHub Actions and give it a shot.

## CircleCI

Here's the CircleCI config I was using. It installs the dependencies and runs `yarn test`.

```yml
version: 2
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/node:10.15.0
    steps:
      - checkout
      - restore_cache:
          name: Restoring dependencies
          keys:
            - dependencies-v1-{{ checksum "yarn.lock" }}
      - run:
          name: Installing dependencies
          command: yarn
      - save_cache:
          name: Saving dependencies
          paths:
            - ~/.cache/yarn
            - node_modules
          key: dependencies-v1-{{ checksum "yarn.lock" }}
      - run:
          name: Running tests
          command: yarn test
```

## GitHub Actions

> GitHub Actions supports Node.js, Python, Java, Ruby, PHP, Go, Rust, .NET, and more. Build, test, and deploy applications in your language of choice.

I can achieve the **exact configuration** as CircleCI with GitHub Actions ðŸŽ‰

```yml:.github/workflows/workflow.yml
name: CI
on: pull_request
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
        with:
          fetch-depth: 1
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: 10.15.0
      - name: Installing dependencies
        run: yarn install --frozen-lockfile
      - name: Running tests
        run: yarn test
```

After adding this file at `.github/workflows/workflow.yml`, you'll be able to see each run show up under the "Actions" tab.

I've defined my check to happen on every pull request.

## Conclusion

GitHub Actions has been excellent so far. Plus, there's a lot more I could do with Actions.
You can run a workflow on any GitHub event (e.g. push, issue creation, releases, etc) and even:

- [Deploy to AWS/Kubernetes](https://github.com/actions/aws)
- [Publish a package to NPM](https://github.com/actions/npm)
- [Create a ticket in JIRA](https://github.com/atlassian/gajira)
- [Label and close stale issues and pull requests](https://github.com/actions/stale)

I'm looking forward to seeing the adoption of GitHub Actions as it releases to the public.
